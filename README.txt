Description: animals_bitmap.py* creates a sorted and unsorted bitmap of an "animals" data file, and
compresses them using 32 and 64-bit word WAH. To run the program, make sure the animals.txt file is
in the same directory as the program. Running the program by itself will add all bitmaps and compressed
bitmaps to the current working directory as .txt files, as well as a sorted copy of the data. If a 
different animals data file is to be compressed, change the "animals.txt" argument for the make_bitmap()
and order_animals() functions to the new filename, in the main function of the file.

*The program is a stand-alone file.
